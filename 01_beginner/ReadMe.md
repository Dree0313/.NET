# Tier 1: Beginner — .NET Foundations

## Purpose
This section focuses on **.NET language and runtime fluency**.  
The goal is to become comfortable reading, understanding, and writing basic .NET/C# programs with correct syntax and predictable behavior.

At this stage, the emphasis is on:
- Understanding what .NET is and how it runs programs
- Becoming familiar with basic C# syntax and structures
- Building confidence writing simple applications

---

## Concepts Covered

### .Net Overview
- [What .Net is: Runtime + libraries + support languages](01_.Net_Overview/01_What_.Net_is:_Runtime_+_libraries_+_support_languages.cs)
- [CLR (Common Language Runtime): Executes programs and manages memory](01_.Net_Overview/02_CLR_(Common_Language_Runtime):_Executes_programs_and_manages_memory.cs)
- [IL (Intermediate Language): What C# code is compiled to before execution](01_.Net_Overview/03_IL_(Intermediate_Language)_What_Csharp_code_is_compiled_to_before_execution.cs)
- [.NET SDK vs Runtime: SDK includes tools to build programs; Runtime only runs them](01_.Net_Overview/04_.NET_SDK_vs_Runtime:_SDK_includes_tools_to_build_programs;_Runtime_only_runs_them.cs)
- Project Types:
  - [Console apps (basic programs)](01_.Net_Overview/05_Console_apps_(basic_programs).cs)
  - [Class libraries (reusable code components)](01_.Net_Overview/06_Class_libraries_(reusable_code_components).cs)

### C# Basics
- [Variables: Declaring and using different types (`int`, `string`, `bool`, etc.)](02_Csharp_Basics)
- Loops: `for`, `while`, `foreach`
- Conditionals: `if`, `else if`, `else`, `switch`
- Methods: Declaring, calling, passing, parameters, and returning values
- Classes & Objects:
  - Defining classes
  - Creating objects
  - Understanding properties and methods

## Expected Outcome
After completing this tier, I should be able to:
- Understand what .NET is and how programs run on the CLR
- Write simple console applications in C#
- Use basic C# syntax: variables, loops, conditionals, and methods
- Define classes and create objects
- Build confidence in navigating a .NET development environment (VS Code)
